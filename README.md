# Experimental Evaluation of MST Algorithms
Experimental analysis on the impact of different algorithms and heap-based data
structures for the minimal spanning tree problem on directed and undirected
graphs. The goal is to identify strengths and weaknesses of various approaches
in order to guide application programmers towards the best choice for their
applications. The study is conducted on random graphs of various size and
density. You can read a complete overview of the project and its results in the
[report](report.pdf).

Focus of our study are:
- Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms for the minimum spanning tree problem; 
- Chuâ€“Liu/Edmonds' algorithm for the minimum spanning arborescence problem;
- binary, d-ary and Fibonacci heaps data structures and counting sort.

You are welcome to read the conclusions in the final section of the report.

## How to use it
If you are using the [nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager you can run `nix
develop` in the project directory to install dependencies; otherwise, you must
install [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest) and
[benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark).
- `make all`: compiles and runs the tests; and
- `make benchmark`: compiles and runs the benchmarks.

All the plots are draw using Python's matplotlib. Scripts to generate the plots
in the report can be found in the [results](results) directory. Those scripts
were specifically made to generate plots for the report and they are not
intended to be reused; nevertheless, you can give it a shot by generating your
`.bench` data with, for example, `./bin/size > results/mst-size.bench`. In this
case, you should probably tweak [main.cpp](main.cpp) as you like; for example,
comment out out the stuff you don't need and set custom `nodes`, `degrees` and
`weights` parameters.
